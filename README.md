# nix

These are my NixOS and Home-manager configurations for my laptop and my [servers](https://renn.es). They are based on the very good [nix-starter-configs](https://github.com/Misterio77/nix-starter-configs) template.

Main hosts (others are rarely running servers):
- `framy`: My daily driver Framework laptop.
- `issou`: A thinkcentre 1L server.
- `chorizo`: An OVH VPS used as a VPN host and network gateway.

Home-manager users:
- `tarneo`: Me, on my laptop.
- `risitas`: An administrator user on the servers.

Previous versions of my dotfiles are available on my [.f](https://github.com/tarneaux/.f) repo.
